### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Shreya Asthana, a B.Tech CSE (AI/ML) student at VIT Bhopal.

I'm a B.Tech Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at VIT Bhopal, with a strong passion for problem-solving, full-stack development, and data-driven solutions.

My technical foundation includes proficiency in **Java and Python**, along with solid experience in **Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
In terms of development, I work comfortably across the stack â€” from **frontend technologies** like **HTML, CSS, and React.js**, to **backend development** using **Flask**, and **databases** like **SQL and MongoDB**.  
I also have a growing interest in **data science and analytics**, with hands-on experience using **Power BI** and **Tableau** to create insightful visualizations.

I believe in building real-world projects to apply what I learn â€” whether it's deploying machine learning models or creating interactive web apps.  
My goal is to continuously learn, grow, and contribute to impactful tech solutions.
