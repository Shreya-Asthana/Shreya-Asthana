### Hi there, I'm Shreya Asthana! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m a B.Tech Computer Science student at VIT Bhopal, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a strong passion for data analytics and solving real-world problems through data-driven insights.

ðŸ’¡ I enjoy working with tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau to explore, analyze, and visualize data. Iâ€™ve completed hands-on simulations with Deloitte, PwC, and Tata through Forage, where I created dashboards, derived business insights, and delivered value through effective communication and analysis.

ðŸ”§ My core strengths include:

Data Visualization & Dashboarding (Power BI, Tableau)

Data Analysis & Modeling (Python, SQL, Excel)

Communication of insights for business decisions

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m currently seeking internship opportunities in data analytics or data science where I can learn, contribute, and grow alongside a collaborative team.
